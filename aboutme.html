        <h2>Welcome! This is my About Me page !</h2>
        <p> <strong>Hi!</strong> my name is Firuz Ergil. I'm from a small island called Cyprus. I was born in 1994 so, I
            was 90s Child. I am currently a Pharmacist who hates her job and looking for an oppurtunity to change the
            idea of working in same place, same difficulties. I was searching for something interesting, challenging and
            then I find that Web developing is what I need.</p>
